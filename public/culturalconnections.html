          The two differences that I experimented when I move to Canada was the
          most efficient transport system, always on time and always be
          respectful each other in the bus. And the second difference is
          everybody is quite kind and don't be so rude each other. Back in
          Ecuador people are are quite disrespectful and usually are in bad
          mood.

          There are two tings that I miss more, the food and my family. The food
          here is very different almost everything are imported from Mexico or
          USA. And It's normal that I miss my family... I grow up with them and
          now they are not by my side to just look for me... Now I'm alone,
          making my own life, my own decisions.

          There are two amazing things that I love here, the efficient transport
          and the beautiful landscape here. It's a land full of opportunities
          and new discovers. Yo for sure meet great people and amazing
          professionals here.
